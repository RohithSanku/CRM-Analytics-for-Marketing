#CRM Analytics For Marketing
The objective of this project is to optimize marketing campaigns, enhance customer engagement, and drive revenue growth for the organization by leveraging CRM data. 
This will be achieved through the implementation of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and item-based collaborative filtering techniques. 
By gaining insights into customer behavior, preferences, and purchase patterns, we aim to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue generation opportunities.
